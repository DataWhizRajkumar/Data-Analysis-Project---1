# Data-Analysis-Project---1
This project aims to predict the sales of a product or service based on the amount of advertising spent on TV. It utilizes a linear regression model, a fundamental machine learning technique, to establish a relationship between TV advertising expenditures and sales.
What the project does:

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression analysis using Python and the scikit-learn library. It takes a dataset from a CSV file containing information on TV advertising budgets and corresponding sales figures. The project performs the following tasks:

Loads the dataset.
Separates the dataset into features (TV advertising budgets) and the target variable (sales).
Splits the data into a training set and a testing set.
Creates a Linear Regression model and fits it to the training data.
Uses the trained model to make predictions on the testing data.
Visualizes the results by plotting the original data points and the regression line.
Why the project is useful:

This project is useful for several reasons:

It serves as an educational example for those learning about linear regression, a fundamental machine learning technique.
It provides a practical demonstration of how to load, preprocess, and analyze data using Python and scikit-learn.
It shows how to create a simple predictive model that can be used for making predictions based on input data, which has various real-world applications in fields like marketing, economics, and business analysis.
